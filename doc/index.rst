=======================

Bob_ is a free signal-processing and machine learning toolbox originally
developed by the Biometrics group at `Idiap`_ Research Institute, Switzerland.

The toolbox is written in a mix of `Python`_ and `C++`_ and is designed to be
both efficient and reduce development time. It is composed of a reasonably
large number of `packages`_ that implement tools for image, audio & video
processing, machine learning & pattern recognition, and a lot more task
specific packages.
